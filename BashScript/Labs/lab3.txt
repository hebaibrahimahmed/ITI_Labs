case $ch in 
[a-z}) echo "lower Case";;
[A-Z}) echo "Uper Case";;
[0-9}) echo "it is a Number";;
 *) echo "default"
    esac 

2-Enhanced the previous script, by checking the type of string entered by a user: 

read -p "Enter a String " String

case $String in 

+([a-z}) echo "lower Case";;
+([A-Z}) echo "Uper Case";;
+([0-9}) echo "it is a Number";;
 +([a-zA-z]) ) echo "Mixed Character" ;;
  +([a-zA-z0-9]) ) echo "Mixed Character and Number";;
    *)echo "default"
    esac 

3-Write a script called mychmod using for utility to give execute permission 
to all files and directories in your home directory. 
for i in `ls $1`
do 
    #chmod +x $1/$i
    #chmod +x ~/Assiut_Bash/dir1file1
    #chmod +x file2
    #chmod +x file3
done 
set -x # Enable debug  
for i in `ls $1/*`
do 
    echo $i
    #chmod +x ~/Assiut_Bash/dir1file1
    #chmod +x file2
    #chmod +x file3
done 

4-Write a script called mybackup using for utility to create a backup of only files 
in your home directory.

line =$(ls)
mkdir mybackup 
for i in $line mybackup 
done 
ls -l mybackup 

echo "Done"

5- Write a script called mymail using for utility to send a mail to all users in the system
Note: write the mail body in a file called mtemplate

6-

mail [nameofuser] < [letterFile]

select p in ls ls_a exit 
do 
case $p in 
(ls) ls $1 ;;
(ls_a) ls $1;;
(exit) break ;;
esac
done 

9- 

read -p "Enter the Elements of the Array : " arr

for i in ${arr[@]}
do
echo "Element : " $i
done 

10-

read -p "Enter the Array Size : " Size
sum = 0
i=1

while [$i -le $size ]
do 
red -p "Enter Number : " Num

sum = $((sum+Num))
done
avg= ' echo "scale=2;$sum/$Size" | bc'

#avg=$(echo $sum / $Size | bc -1)
echo "The Average = " $avg

11- 
mysqr(){
read -p "Enter a Number : " Num
sqrt=$(echo "$num" | awk '{print sqrt ($1)}')
echo "Squere of $Num = $sqrt"}
